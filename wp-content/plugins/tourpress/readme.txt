== Description ==

Integrate WordPress with [TourPress](http://www.tourpress.com "TourPress") to aid creating Wholesale, Retail, Corporate Travel & Tour Operator websites.

This plugin extends WordPress with new Post types for Accommodation, Tourâ€¦ (and other travel products) and integrates with the TourPress booking engine. Upload your prices once (into TourPress) and ensure you are always displaying live pricing and booking against live availability. 

Includes widgets for displaying products on Google Maps or showing a monthly availability overview and a basic example theme can be downloaded from our website (or customise your existing theme).

Store complex pricing, availability, bookings and customer data secure in TourPress. Use WordPress templates to design and build your website, integrating with TourPress for the booking/enquiry process.

The TourPress booking engine is configurable in 20+ languages (let us know if you need one we don't currently support) and integrates with various payment gateway solutions from around the world.

**This plugin requires a paid [TourPress](http://www.tourpress.com "TourPress") account, free trial accounts are available**

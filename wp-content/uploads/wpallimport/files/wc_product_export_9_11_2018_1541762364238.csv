The RealCare Programme has been used in parenting and teen pregnancy prevention programmes around the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom and Mexico.

During a simulation, the RealCare Baby’s appearance and behaviours replicate those of a real baby. A participant must provide proper infant care - feeding, burping, rocking and changing the baby according to a schedule programmed by the instructor. Several schedules of varying difficulty are available, each based on the experiences of real-life parents. An internal computer records the participant’s response to each care event, as well as temperature, clothing and time spent in the car seat. At the end of the simulation, the RealCare Baby communicates wirelessly with the Control Centre Software to submit a report on the participant’s performance.

The Pregnancy Profile Simulator is a vest that simulates the look and feel of the third trimester of pregnancy.

The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Drug-Affected Baby simulators mimic the potential results of substance abuse during pregnancy.

The Shaken Baby simulator demonstrates the brain damage caused by shaking an infant.

Altogether, the Total Parenting Experience provides a holistic and innovative approach to teaching parenting skills and promoting healthy choices.

<h2 dir=""ltr"">Features</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>The Text-to-Speech supported word processor and voice recorder can help to improve the quality of your learners' speech.</li>
 	<li>Clicker’s clear speech and word predictor helps to develop vocabulary and promotes auto-correction of spelling.</li>
 	<li>The talking word processor allows learners to review sentences or words, and punctuating their work gives them instant feedback.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Build confidence with Clicker Grid Sets</h3>
Grid Sets enable children to write with whole words, helping them to write independently. Clicker 7 makes it easier to create and edit your own Clicker Grid Sets, and there are hundreds of ready-made sets to choose from.
<h3>Review writing with clear children’s voices</h3>
Clicker’s brand new children’s voices give students the opportunity to hear their work read back to them in a friendly, age-appropriate voice that they can identify with. This realistic speech feedback encourages them to actively review and self-correct their work.
<h3>Develop vocabulary and spelling with word prediction</h3>
Upgraded for version 7, Clicker’s intelligent word predictor suggests words that fit the context of students’ writing, encouraging them to use more adventurous vocabulary. Children are able to create flowing pieces of text with accurate spelling and grammatically correct sentences.
<h3>Organise ideas with Clicker Board</h3>
Clicker Board is a new, child-friendly planning and organising tool, where students manipulate words, pictures and sounds. Easily flick between the board and the document while writing, or instantly transform the board into a word bank. It’s great for individuals, for groups and for the whiteboard.
<h3>Capture thoughts and rehearse sentences with Voice Notes</h3>
Voice Notes are a new and powerful way for children to capture their thoughts and ideas. Use Voice Notes to rehearse sentences before writing, or to capture ideas on the fly. They are saved with the document, so they’re still there when you come back!
<h3>Provide personalised writing support with Word Pool</h3>
What happens when children need to include unusual words or names in their writing? With the new Word Pool, you can add any word to Clicker’s knowledge base and ensure it is pronounced properly by the speech engine, picked up by the predictor and accepted by the spellchecker. Word Pool can also be used to tackle specific spelling patterns students are really struggling with.
<h3>Make the curriculum accessible for all</h3>
Crick Software is committed to providing software that enables every student to access the curriculum and achieve success. Clicker 7 has more accessibility features than ever before, including SuperKeys and eye gaze compatibility.

Yenka Programming is an interactive, exciting way to teach and learn computer control and programming.  The program lets you use simple flowcharts to control either human characters or virtual animations through a series of steps and instructions.
<h2>How it works</h2>
Start your flowchart:  Choose from a range of different actions for each character - dance steps, movements and interactions - which can be programmed using flowcharts. Give as many commands as you like, in your preferred order, and edit parameters with a click.

Errors will be highlighted and explained as your program runs, and a monitor shows variable values changing.

If you want to, add a backing track for your characters to dance to - choose from the 23 included or import your own tracks. A slider lets you synchronise your dancers to the beat.

Duxbury Braille Translator Software (DBT) allows you to convert print-based text into braille and braille into text for printing.  DBT can allow you to import Microsoft Word documents, translates these into braille, and sends the braille to your braille embosser or braille device.

DBT provides translation and formatting functions to automate the process of converting from regular print to braille (and the other way around).  Duxbury Braille Translator Software also provides word-processing facilities for working directly in the braille as well as the print.

DBT software is designed for both people who don't know braille and those who do. The Duxbury Braille Translator (DBT) can allow anyone to create highly accurate braille for learning and teaching support materials, office memos, bus schedules, personal letters, signs and more.
<h2>Product Features:</h2>

	<li>Duxbury DBT can import Microsoft Word 2007/2010/2013 files, as well as Open Office files.</li>
	<li>DBT allows languages other than the principal language to be embedded in the same file and treated as appropriate for the context. (Contact us if you have questions about a specific language.) Now braille for foreign-language texts and language teaching texts is a snap.</li>
	<li>Bidirectional (print-to-braille and braille-to-print) translation for most languages.</li>
	<li>DBT is there to help you learn new languages. DBT includes support for the IPA notation, American-style Hebrew, and the form of Greek used by American scholars. Of course, DBT also directly supports the braille for most of the languages that are taught at the secondary level or college level.</li>
	<li>Accurate presentation of both print or braille in either WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) or coded (how-you-get-what-you-want) views in the word-processing screen, with easy switching between views</li>

Megadots is a powerful DOS braille translator with a Windows Installer, designed for the volume transcriber and producer who is working for American or British braille readers.

The straightforward, style-based system and automated features of Megadots allow you to create great braille with only a few keystrokes. Do not be fooled, Megadots is also sophisticated enough to please the fussiest braille producers - allowing you to control each step to format, translate and produce braille documents.

MegaDots and Duxbury DBT now work much closer together. It is easy to bring DBT files into MegaDots, and bring MegaDots files into DBT.
<h2>Product Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Runs on 32-bit Windows versions: XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. MegaDots 2.5 will not run on 64-bit systems without the use of a virtual PC. MegaDots 2.5 automatically installs your Windows icons.</li>
	<li>Includes improved script files for JAWS for Windows</li>
	<li>Imports Word 2003/2007/2010 files.</li>
	<li>Since MegaDots recognizes many file formats, you can bring in virtually any document and set it up for braille. MegaDots supports all commercial braille embossers and all modern inkprint printers (except for a small group of inkprint printers that are Windows-only).</li>
	<li>When you view the braille looks, press the Translate key. Suddenly you're looking at the same words, but in braille! You can jump around, edit or enter more braille. Braille entry can be done using a six-key technique, or as ""Inkprint in braille"", where the words you type become braille as you type them. When you are done in braille, press the Translate key once more and you return to print.</li>
	<li>Users of voice and refreshable braille displays will appreciate interacting with software tailored for blind access. Screens are simple and free of clutter, and you don't have to fuss around to know where you are in the software. When you move into a new area, the name of the screen is spoken, such as ""Editor"", ""Main menu"" or ""Save file help"".</li>
	<li>For large print users, MegaDots supports popular screen enlargement programs, as well as a built-in large text mode. You'll never have to scroll around looking for text or information that's off the screen. All you need to see is right there in front of you.</li>
	<li>For sighted users, MegaDots has a familiar look and feel. Pull-down menus, point and click mouse interaction and colorful screens make working fun. The braille itself can be viewed in a variety of forms, depending on what is most readable for you.</li>
	<li>MegaDots gives you the features you expect from a modern word processor, such as macros, bookmarks, and find and replace.</li>

<h2>Does Typing Chemical Equations Give You Nightmares?</h2>
So by using Chemical Equations may not give you nightmares but it certainly is not much fun. Superscripts, subscripts, italics and arrows are all tedious to produce. Let FX Chem save you time.
<h3>FX Chem makes typing chemical equations almost as easy as typing your name.</h3>
With FX Chem, you  type the information and FX Chem will do the format for  you. FX Chem understands enough about chemistry to recognise the various components of a chemical equation and puts them in the right place for you.

For example: If you want

<img alt="""" src=""http://www.efofex.com/images/fc2_eqn1.gif"" width=""474"" height=""29"" />

load FX Chem and type

nio2(s)   2h2o(l)   2e- =&gt;ni(oh)2(s)   2oh-(aq)

No more work needs to be done. FX Chem will capitalise the elements and put everything in the correct location -  automatically. FX Chem is very simple to use that we have put all the instructions you need to use it on one side of one piece of paper ... with room to spare.
<ul>
	<li>Nuclear chemistry. {238,92} U becomes <img alt="""" src=""http://www.efofex.com/images/fc2_eqn2.gif"" width=""44"" height=""29"" /></li>
	<li>Chemistry everywhere. You can now have formatted chemical equations above and below reaction arrows.</li>
	<li>Normal text everywhere. Wrapping something in quotes stops FX Chem from formatting it.</li>
	<li>Multi line equations</li>
	<li>Much more control over the output.</li>
	<li>Much better handling of complex ions and other chemical constructs</li>
</ul>
FX Chem links into your copy of Word and lets you enter chemical equations at the push of a button

Dynamo Maths is a step-by-step learning program that supports the needs of children struggling with maths.  The solution is packaged in a three-stage on-line intervention and remediation program for dyscalculics and low maths achievers.

The software has been specifically designed for learners with learning difficulties such as dyscalculia, dyslexia and Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  The software is based on the NumberSenseMMR framework.

Ideally, Dynamo Maths would be combined with a <a href=""http://editmicro.co.za/product/dynamo-profiler/"" target=""_blank"">Dynamo Profiler Assessment</a>, identifying areas of weakness and dyscalculia symptoms for development.  <a href=""http://editmicro.co.za/product/dynamo-profiler/"" target=""_blank"">Dynamo Profiler</a> can be used as a pre-assessment for remedial educators to establish whether the leaner requires further professional  supportive learning. Dynamo Maths can then be incorporated into a learner's Individual Support Plan (ISP).

<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7I6CVxj5Wk"" width=""420"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>

<h2>What is Dyscalculia?</h2>
Dyscalculia is a condition that affects the ability to acquire mathematical skills.  Dyscalculic learners may have difficulty understanding simple number concepts, lack an intuitive grasp of numbers, and have problems learning number facts and procedures.  This pattern of abilities and weaknesses is known as ‘specific learning difficulties’.

Purely dyscalculic learners who have difficulties only with numbers will have cognitive and language abilities in the normal range and may excel in nonmathematical subjects, or they may be found to have language difficulties as well, such as dyslexia.
<h2>What about Dyslexia?</h2>
Dyslexia is a spectrum of disorders that involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols.

Often, those who have difficulties in deciphering written words should also have difficulty in learning the sets of facts, notation and symbols that are used in mathematics.  This pattern of abilities and weaknesses is known as ‘specific learning difficulties’.

Dyslexics usually experience problems with the language of mathematics, sequencing, orientation and memory, rather than with the mathematics itself.  Dyslexic learners find it difficult to produce mental or written answers quickly, and the need to ‘learn by heart’ for pupils who have poor memory systems may well result in failure and lack of self-belief.

Some dyslexic learners will enjoy the flexibility of approach and methods while, for others, choice creates uncertainty, confusion and anxiety.
<h2>Dynamo for Autism</h2>
It is a well known fact that children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have special interest in numbers through repetitive behaviors and can take the form of intense preoccupations or obsessions.  With some children, this extreme interests in numbers, symbols, dates or locations on maps can take years before the understanding of maths concepts behind numbers emerges. Children with ASD demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine and there is tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities.

Like many other skills that we also need to teach children with ASD the mathematical concepts and the developmental stages need to start with the foundations of number sense before counting.  Dynamo Math modules start at very basic level of Visual Patterns, building in small steps towards maths concepts.

The modules provide an opportunity to build confidence through visual online activities, as well as teaching of number concepts on a one-to-one through touch, feel and play using the structured teaching lesson plans. The lesson plans are designed to play games that help develop conceptual understanding, thinking strategies and confidence with maths.

11744,simple,,"Induction Loop System",1,0,visible,,"<h1>Induction Loop System</h1>
A loop system can assist a person with a hearing loss or hearing impairment who may use a hearing aid or cochlear implant or Loop listeners (Bellman &amp; Symfon Audio Maxi) ® to hear sounds more clearly by reducing or eliminating background noise.
<h2>How a Loop System Works</h2>
The system begins with the sound source - a microphone placed in front of the person speaking or from a direct connection from another sound source, such as a sound system.

This sound sends a signal to a loop amplifier, that feeds an induction loop cable.  The induction loop cable circles the listening area, producing an electric current which generates a magnetic field.

The resulting electric current in the loop produces a magnetic field, which corresponds to the sound.

You can then pick up this magnetic field if you are sitting within the area of the loop and your hearing aid/cochlear implant or a loop listener (Bellman &amp; Symfon Audio Maxi)® is switched to 'T'.

You will need to adjust your own hearing instrument for volume. NB: You hearing instrument must be programmed to use “T‐coil” (refer to your Audiologist)
<h2>How can you use a loop system?</h2>
If you have a hearing instrument with a 'T' setting all you have to do is switch to 'T'.

If you do not have a suitable hearing instrument you can still use a loop, but you will also need a loop listener.

Some loop listeners are worn with headphones or earphones. More than one person can benefit from a loop installed in a room as long as they each have a hearing instrument set to 'T', or a loop listener. You are not wired to any other equipment and you are therefore free to listen from anywhere within the loop and to move around.

11749,simple,,"Bellman Visit 868 Paging System for Hearing Impaired and Deaf",1,0,visible,,"<h1>Bellman Visit 868 Paging System</h1>
The Bellman Visit 868 is a customizable system of transmitters and receivers designed to allow someone with a hearing impairment to be alerted to various events in their home, such as a doorbell,smoke alarm or even a baby crying.

The Bellman Visit 868 System consists of a number of radio transmitters and receivers. The transmitters detect different events in the surrounding area and transmit a radio signal to the receivers. The receivers pick up this signal and provide indications using light, sound and/or vibration.

And, instead of lugging round several different flashing and vibrating receivers for each alert, the Bellman system will alert you to everything, via one simple device that you choose.
<h2>Choice of Receivers:</h2>
The receiver is the method of alerting the user, various types of receivers are available.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Flash Receiver</strong> - for indoor use, attracts attention with a flashing light, light signal, <em>and also by vibration if a Bellman Bed-shaker (accessory) is connecte</em>d</li>
 	<li><strong>Portable Receiver</strong> - for indoor use, attracts attention user using sound, light <em>and also vibration if a Bellman Bed-shaker (accessory) is connected</em></li>
 	<li><strong>Portable Audio Receiver</strong> - for indoor use, attracts attention using sound and light</li>
 	<li><strong>Pager</strong> - for indoor use, attracts attention using light and vibrations.  Connects to a <strong>Charger</strong>, charging for up to 8 hours, and can connect to a <em>Bellman Bed-shaker <em>(accessory)</em></em></li>
 	<li><strong>Alarm Clock</strong> - for indoor use, attracts attention using sound and light signals <em>and also vibration if a Bellman Bed-shaker (accessory) is connected</em></li>
 	<li><strong>Portable Flash Receiver</strong> - for indoor use, attracts attention with a flashing light, light signal, <em>and also by vibration if a  Bellman Bed Shaker (accessory) is connected</em></li>
 	<li><strong>Wrist Receiver and Charger</strong> - for indoor use, attracts attention using light and vibrations</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Guard Receiver</strong> -The Guard Receiver is the central unit in a Smoke Alarm System. The Guard receiver works like a normal receiver and provides indications using flashing lights, LEDs and vibration. In addition, it monitors whether there are faults or problems with the vibrator, radio contact with the smoke alarms or whether the batteries are becoming flat. If there is a fault, the Guard Receiver will give a warning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choice of Transmitters:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Door Transmitter</strong> - recognises the sound emitted by a doorbell</li>
 	<li><strong>Pushbutton Transmitter</strong> -for indoor use and outdoor use in sheltered locations, transmits signals to the receiverswhen the Pushbutton is pressed</li>
 	<li><strong>Telephone Transmitter</strong> - for indoor use, recognises ring signals from an analogue telephone system via a plug, which is inserted into the telephone socket. In addition to using the telephone input, the telephone transmitter can also operate as a multifunction transmitter, either via a <em><strong>pushbutton</strong> </em>or via 2 connectors for an external trigger. All inputs can be detected separately and transmit different signal patterns to the receivers in the Bellman Visit 868 system depending on which has activated thetelephone transmitter. There is a range of options for connecting the telephone transmitter to various applications.</li>
 	<li><strong>Smoke Alarm</strong> - for indoor use, detects smoke and heat. Most effective as part of the Fire Alarm System</li>
 	<li><strong>Baby Cry Transmitter</strong> - for indoor use, recognises the sound from a crying baby</li>
 	<li><strong>Repeater</strong> -for indoor use, receives a radio signal from a transmitter in the Bellman Visit 868 System and transmits this radio signal to the receivers in the system</li>
 	<li><strong>Bridge</strong> - for indoor use and operates as an interpreter, which conveys radio signals between the Bellman Visit and Bellman Visit 868 systems</li>
 	<li><strong>Smoke Alarm Transmitter</strong> - indoor use, detects smoke. When smoke is detected, the Smoke Alarm will transmit a fire alarm signal to all Bellman Visit 868 receivers which are within its range</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>A Bellman Visit 868 Fire Alarm System consists of:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>1 Bellman Visit 868 Guard Receiver BE1465</li>

13934,simple,,"Dynamo Profiler",1,0,visible,,"<h1>Dynamo Profiler Dyscalculia Assessment</h1>
Dynamo Profiler is the first simple on-line test that helps you to identify areas of developmental dyscalculia and maths developmental delays, and informs you of specific areas of difficulty.  These areas can then be addressed through a tailored remediation programme such as <a href=""http://editmicro.co.za/product/dynamo-maths/"">Dynamo Maths</a>.

The strength of Dynamo Profiler assessment lies in the way it captures the child’s individual variation in their number sense development, using the NumberSenseMMR framework. This enables children at high risk of dyscalculia to be identified.

<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Fcmzk_0CNU"" width=""420"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>

The assessment captures a snapshot view of the child's unique number sense development and serves as a basis for tailoring an individual and purposeful intervention. The dyscalculia Profiler has drawn learning from neuroscience research, particularly the areas of the brain that are involved in processing numbers.

All the test questions are age adaptive.

<strong>Age</strong>: The assessment is measured at ages 6, 7, 8 and 9. If the learner's age is above 9 then the baseline report will be for age 9.

<strong>Time</strong>: It takes on average 20-40 minutes, depending on the child’s individual needs.

<strong>Results</strong>: The test generates results instantly. The scores are presented within the broad areas of the NumberSenseMMR™ framework and easy to follow.
<h2>Licensing Options</h2>
Dynamo Profiler Licenses are annual, and available for school or home purchase

This allows you to track the child's progress over the year, which is most effective when used in combination with the Dynamo maths remediation programme
<h2>Free Trial</h2>

The need for schools to equip students with the ‘life skill’ of touch typing has never been more essential. Research has shown that touch typists work faster, smarter and with much less stress.

<strong>KAZ’s simple method requires minimum supervision and is effective for all ages 6 to adult. Learn from school, home or anywhere. </strong>

If individuals with special educational needs / dyslexia are equipped with the correct tools, they stand a greater chance of reaching their full potential.

<h2>High Quality Braille at the Lowest</h2>
The Orbit Reader 20 is the world’s most affordable Refreshable Braille Display.  It is a unique 3-in-1 device and serves as a self-contained book reader, a note-taker and as a braille display by connecting to a computer or smartphone via USB or Bluetooth.

Equipped with a 20-cell 8-dot display, the Orbit Reader 20 is based on revolutionary braille cell technology developed by Orbit Research.  The breakthrough technology uses mainstream components and manufacturing processes to enable unique signage-quality refreshable braille at a fraction of the cost of the piezoelectric technology that has been used in braille cells so far.

When used as a standalone reader, it enables the user to read any file from the SD card.  These could be BRF and BRL formatted books, text files or files in any format.  This allows students, especially in developing countries, to have content loaded on to the SD card by teachers and use the unit without any live connectivity to a computer or the internet.  The reader has features for easy navigation, inserting and editing bookmarks, browsing through folders, etc.

As a braille display, the Orbit Reader connects to PCs and Macs, iOS devices and Android devices.  It provides Bluetooth and USB connectivity and can connect simultaneously to multiple devices. Using the screen reading capability on the computing device, such as Voiceover, Brailleback or popular PC screen readers the user can control the functions of their computer or smartphone, use their favorite apps, read and send text messages and email and browse the internet.

As a note-taker, the Orbit Reader offers all essential file creation and editing functions.  A user can create new files, save them on SD card and edit existing files.  The Orbit Reader also includes file management features, allowing the user to rename, delete, copy, and create folders and files.

<em><strong>The device is inherently language independent and prompts and menus can be easily localized for different geographies.</strong></em>

While it offers a host of features, the Orbit Reader 20 is extremely easy to use and allows seamless and instantaneous switching between reader, note-taker and braille display modes, as well as selection between connected devices such as a computer or phone.

The Orbit Reader 20 is very compact, measuring a little over an inch in height and about 6 inches by 4 inches and weighing under a pound.  It includes a high-quality Perkins style keyboard with 8 keys and a space bar. It also has a cursor pad with 4 arrow keys and a select button, as well as rocker keys on each side of the braille display to control navigation.

On the back of the unit is a recess in which are located an SD Card slot, a USB Micro B socket and a power button.

The unit is powered by a user-replaceable fast-charging lithium battery which is recharged through the USB port.  It is fluid and dust resistant and its construction is optimized for durability in extreme environmental conditions.",,,taxable,,1,,0,0,,,,,0,,,0,"Interests > a) Department of Education, Interests > b) Educational Institution, Interests > c) Educator, Interests > d) Special Needs and Inclusion, Product Brands, Product Brands > Orbit, Product Types > e) Special Needs and Inclusion, Product Types > e) Special Needs and Inclusion > Blindness and Low Vision, Product Types > f) Early Childhood Development > Remedial and Special Needs, Product Types > g) Foundation Phase > Remedial and Special Needs, Product Types > h) Intermediate Phase, Product Types > h) Intermediate Phase > Remedial and Special Needs","blind, blindness, device for blind and low vision, device for low vision and blind, orbit",,http://editmicro.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Orbit-Reader-20.jpg,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,

<strong>Adhesive, matt, rewritable screen.</strong>

The front side is made with a special OPP layer finely matted and scratch-proof – easy to clean without negative consequences for the projected image. No stains appear even after months of intensive use. The matt surface grants very high resolution when projecting – over 4K – but especially it reduces eye-strain by eliminating any unwanted reflections from the screen, such as lamps, windows and shadows. The screen has the same brightness values all over the entire surface from any viewing position. As a result, the only reflected thing is the projected image, leaving the viewer's mind free from filtering secondary images, such as reflections and shadows.

The shape matches natural hand movement and the key arrangement minimises finger movement, raising speed and relieving frustration.

The special shape and letter layout have been very carefully planned, taking into account the limited number of keys that can be accessed quickly and comfortably.

Word-processing input speeds of 85 words per minute have been demonstrated by operators using Maltron single handed keyboards. The fully ergonomic shape ensures freedom from strain and no RSI type problems have been reported in over 10 years, although all the work is done by one hand!

Both Left and Right hand models are designed for ""Touch Typing"".

These keyboards have Push-On Push-Off keys for Shift, Control and Alt functions; essential for single hand operation. Windows keys are also included.

19087,simple,,"Maltron Expanded Keyboard",1,0,visible,,"The Maltron Expanded keyboard was initially designed with Cerebral Palsy in mind, but it provides enhanced access for most physically disabled and visually impaired users. It is robustly designed with a strong steel construction to withstand heavy use, and has a smooth wipe-clean surface.

<span style=""color: #2a2a2a;"">The keyboard may also be placed on the floor or fixed at the foot of a bed to be used by toes.

This keyboard can be configured by the user to support QWERTY (US English layout) or FOU (Frequency of Use) Letter layouts. The FOU layout may be selected by a special key combination and places the most commonly used keys in a central position on the keyboard, which reduces hand or foot movement to a minimum. The key tops are easily relocated to support either layout by taking off the top cover. Layout diagrams are included in the handbook. Supplied set up with QWERTY (Default) or FOU layout as requested.</span>

<span style=""color: #2a2a2a;"">The large surface area (62cm x 23cm) and built in keyguard are designed to reduce keyboard errors, enabling a higher work rate as a result of more accurate typing and data input. It has a USB connector with an in-line 5-pin DIN type snap-connector. The snap-connector is designed to separate if the connector cable is accidentally pulled tight, thereby helping to prevent damage to the keyboard or computer.

It has large, clear characters and key labels - black on white for alphanumeric and cursor keys, black on pink for function keys and black on yellow for control keys (alternative options are available if required).

We now offer an audio-visual feedback system for the Expanded Keyboard which can be selected as a purchase option. This will enable the Maltron Expanded Keyboard to ""beep"" and show a light whenever a key is correctly pressed. The feature may be turned on or off as desired and may be particularly useful for people with cerebral palsy (CP) who will not need to focus on the keyboard to confirm if a key has been pressed correctly.

<p dir=""ltr"">It is to be noted that, AngelEye can only work when connected with smartphone or specialized control box through USB cable. Also, AngelEye is to simulate the functionality of the human eyes, and has similar requirement of the luminance. Strong light or darkness would reduce the sight of the device, the device would mention user to open the supplemental lighting in the dark, and we would install a lighting in the control box to support it. But the device would still report the “seen” results more conservatively due to the consideration user’s safety. Therefore, we solemnly remind consumers that the device is to assist people to perceive the surroundings but cannot replace the user to make the judge of actions. Visually impaired still need make their own judgment of the surroundings and take the appropriate action, based on all the information perceived.</p>
